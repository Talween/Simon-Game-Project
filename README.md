# Simon-Game-Project

**Play Simon-game, here's information about the game.**

(Wikipedia contributors, 2024)  say that Simon is an electronic game of short-term memory skill. The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is over.

The device has four colored buttons, each producing a particular tone when it is pressed or activated by the device. A round in the game consists of the device lighting up one or more buttons in a random order, after which the player must reproduce that order by pressing the buttons. As the game progresses, the number of buttons to be pressed increases. (This is only one of the games on the device; there are actually other games on the original.) (Wikipedia contributors, 2024)

**Now, let's talk about game functionality.**

**Overview**
The Simon Game is a simple yet challenging memory game where players have to recall and repeat sequences of colored lights in the correct order. With each round, the sequence becomes longer and more difficult, testing the player's memory and concentration.

**Features**
Responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile devices.
Dynamic color sequences that increase in length with each round.
Sound effects corresponding to each color.
Restart and high-score functionality.

**Technologies Used**
HTML: Structure and layout of the game.
CSS: Styling and animation of the game elements.
JavaScript: Game logic and interactivity.

**How to Play**
Start the Game: Press the start button to begin.
Watch the Sequence: The game will display a sequence of colors, with each color lighting up and playing a corresponding sound.
Repeat the Sequence: After the sequence is shown, click on the colors in the correct order to replicate the sequence.

Game Over: The game ends when you click the wrong color. You can restart the game by pressing the start button again.
