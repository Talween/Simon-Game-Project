# Simon-Game-Project
Play Simon-game, here's information about the game.

(Wikipedia contributors, 2024)  say that Simon is an electronic game of short-term memory skill. The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is over.

The device has four colored buttons, each producing a particular tone when it is pressed or activated by the device. A round in the game consists of the device lighting up one or more buttons in a random order, after which the player must reproduce that order by pressing the buttons. As the game progresses, the number of buttons to be pressed increases. (This is only one of the games on the device; there are actually other games on the original.) (Wikipedia contributors, 2024)

**Now, let's talk about game functionality.**
